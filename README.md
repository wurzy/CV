## Peer-Reviewed Publications
["DataGen: JSON/XML/CSV Dataset Generator"](https://github.com/wurzy/datagen) explores the steps taken in the development of DataGen, a versatile and powerful tool that allows for quick prototyping and testing of software applications, offering both the complexity and scalability necessary to generate adequate datasets in order to feed a data API or third party applications, enabling their testing with appropriate data volume and data complexity.
